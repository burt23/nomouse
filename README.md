# nomouse

Discourages mouse usage by dimming screen by 10% of maximum brightness whenever
you left click. Brightness gets restored over next 6.666 seconds.  This is
meant to be annoying and motivate you to learn keyboard shortcuts.

**Currently for OS X only.**

# TODO

 * Windows port
 * Some kind of UI with configurable settings
 * Adjustable max brightness
